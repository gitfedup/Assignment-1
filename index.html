<h2>A little about me!</h2>
<p>Looking for a career shift into IT. Currently selling consumer goods (gift and 
homewares, let's be honest - pool floats) to retailers within Australia but aiming to sell software within a global branded business.<br><br>
<a href="https://imgur.com/HeAXmNu"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HeAXmNu.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br>
<br>
Australian born, with English background I grew up in the north shore suburbs of Sydney. 
My parents bought the family home in Lindfield back in 1978 for a measley $60,000! <br><br>

<br>
Highschool graduation was the year 2000 just before "Y2K" was an actual concern. 2002 I 
found myself studying Fashion Design at Tafe NSW which I loved but never actually used as it 
was intended. <br><br>
My husband and I feel incredibly lucky as we were recently married back in February this year. 
Our wedding day, The 1st February was a perfect sunny hot day, just as the Australian bushfires 
and smoke had settled, a day before 2 weeks of rain and damaging storms struck Sydney and its 
surrounds. To top it all off, just as we got back from our honeymoon in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, 
the very next day, Covid-19 arrived in Australia!<br><br>
We live with my moody cat Daisy whom I absolutely adore, despite the snarling and scratches. Awwww look at her.

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>My interest in IT comes solely from a selfish place. It not only helps me become a more efficient 
human being but also an entertained one. From the simple convenience of my temperature-controlled 
kettle to the use of my iPhone to watch Netflix.  The more computerised the world becomes, the more 
interest I have. <br>
Aside from my personal comfort interests, my business interests lie in being an 
efficient worker. Dealing with my clients remotely it a great benefit for me and the business. I 
look for further efficiencies using any technology whether it be Dropbox to share a large excel file, 
communicating via facetime to show samples or sending a suggested draft order via our online wholesale 
B2B website. Face to face visits are quickly becoming a thing of the past and I'm loving finding the 
solutions and putting them into place. <br>
<br>
My interest in IT started when I was in primary school. There was a wonderfully dark room called 
the 'computer room'. Approximately 12 MS-DOS computers had to be shared for about 45 mins per 
week. We played fantastic games like 'Space Invaders' and 'Lemonade Stand'. Lemonade stand was 
made back in 1979 by Apple. Amazing that in 1992 we were still playing it. <br> 
<br>
<a href="https://imgur.com/ElMU0C9"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ElMU0C9.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br><br>
My interests further developed in high school as my sister had a lovely little Nintendo Gameboy 
that we all loved playing, particularly Donkey Kong. Shortly afterwards the family graduated to a 
Sony PlayStation and in the same year got our very first desktop computer.  I year after, I bought 
my very first mobile phone, a Sony Ericson in Blue with the flip and very obvious antenna. Our family 
life changed a lot as entertainment and information entered the house. Needless to say, I was loving life. <br><br>

I can't say there was a particular moment or person that sparked my interest in IT. However, I must say 
that I'm consistently impressed with my iPhone capabilities and all the applications that make life tasks 
very convenient. <br><br>

My IT experience consists of user experience only, some basic troubleshooting and system integration. 
Where I see myself slightly ahead of the rest is my ability to use basic programs well, that serve a 
business purpose. For example, Microsoft Office Suite, internal OPS and the back end of the B2B website – 
NuOrder. <br><br>

I chose RMIT as it was offering the course I was looking for online and it started immediately. 
The group work element was important to me as I feel collaboration is a key part of the learning process. 
The cost was also competitive at $300 less than a competing course. The brand also resonated with me as I 
felt it was a familiar name. <br><br>

My expectations are to learn about the IT industry in general. Understanding terminologies and verbiage are 
important to me as I look to a career shift, so being confident to communicate with peers and interviewers 
in the future is critical for my plans.  Aside from being able to communicate, a reasonable level of 
understanding how different technologies work and the benefit they have to the world, would be ideal. <br><br>

<br>
<br>


<br>
This is the perfect job for me in 5-7 years time. There are so many elements about this position that excite me. <br>
<br>
This position is a varied role that gives the opportunity to work across the business as well as managing a 
team. Tasks are varied with larger projects being a major part of the role along with smaller unique tasks 
that keeps things interesting. The customer facing aspect is for a true sales person that can confidently 
build trust and relationships via thorough knowledge of the product and be able to communicate the details 
in a precise and simply put way. This role is to analyse data for clients and use it to drive decisions about 
the product across the business. Being a  Sales Operations Manager role, managing the team to reach goals as 
well as focus on continual business processes improvements and strategies. <br>
<br>
This position is particularly interesting to me as it does offer a variety of tasks within a bustling 
environment where you can enjoy being part of a team as well as enjoying client interaction. The appeal 
of analysing data to influence business decisions is ultimately ideal because the arguments are less 
interpretive and more fact based which helps win the argument. Analysing data is interesting to me as it 
tells a unique story that provides intelligence that other forms of information can’t provide. Improving 
business processes is particularly interesting, as this behaviour is a natural instinct for me that I find 
very rewarding. Other appealing aspects of this role that I find appealing is the direct references to 
personality traits within the advertisement. For example, being passionate about data, detailed-orientated, 
analytical, problem solving abilities and being able to communicate complex analytical information in 
a clear and easy to understand way. Some of these traits are results from my personality tests so it 
appears to be a great fit. Other traits are simply a known part of my personality that further draws 
appeal as a good match. <br>
<br>
The skills required for this role are; analytical, problem solver, communication, teamwork, 
attention to detail, computer software and application knowledge, data analysis, negotiation, 
project management, process improvement, client relationships and management. <br>
<br>
The qualifications and experience required are; a bachelor’s degree or equivalent, Microsoft 
office suite, solid experience within a global business, 10 years business experience, 5 years’ 
experience in a similar role, proven success in a similar role. <br>
<br>
The qualifications, skills and experience I currently have are; analytical, problem solver, 
communication, teamwork, attention to detail, negotiation, process improvement, client relationships, 
management and 10 years business experience = bachelor’s degree equivalent. <br>
<br>
The plan to obtain these required skills, experience and qualifications will be to focus on those 
that I am lacking in. <br>
1. Computer Software and Application knowledge – I am currently enrolled in a ‘Introduction to IT with 
RMIT University and I aim to improve my knowledge for this required skill by the course end date in August. <br>
2. Data Analysis & Project Management – additional courses may be required to formalise my limited experience for 
these skills.<br>
3. 5 years in a similar role – once my studies are complete, my search for a similar role will begin. 
I hope to obtain this similar role while I study an MBA with UTS that begins in January 2021.  <br>

<h2>Personality Profile</h2>

<br>
<br>
The results of my personality test are of little surprise and describe me very well. As an ISTP 
personality, being a salesperson seems to be a good fit based on the characteristics required to 
perform well for this job.  This gives me reassurance that I am in the right line of work already 
and that my planned shift into the tech industry is part of my personality as a ‘risk-taker’ but 
also strategically as a ‘problem solver’ and that I am built  ‘adaptable’ and therefore despite 
some self-doubt from time to time, I know that I will achieve my goals. <br>
<br>
My behaviour will be less influenced by the results of the test and more just a true example 
of my personality. In a team environment, to be resourceful, adaptable and an excellent problem 
solver are fantastic characteristics to have. However, being a more reserved type of person can 
mean that my solutions are not heard. Knowing this, does not simply allow me to immediately change 
my behaviour although it’s certainly something to work on. <br>
<br>
When forming a team, I should choose personalities that complement mine. For example, being 
in a team of extroverts would not suit me, nor would a team of pure creatives.  Potentially 
sharing with my team where my strengths lie would be a good idea so my natural abilities 
can be utilised to benefit the team.

<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<p>Virtual 3D Trade Show with Hologram<br><br>
<a href="https://imgur.com/Iruhaz0"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Iruhaz0.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><a href="https://imgur.com/tiguEAe"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tiguEAe.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br><br>

Overview<br><br>
My project is to create an online B2B platform with external hardware hologram function so buyers 
can have a better visualisation of the potential products they are purchasing. The platform will be 
a website that has a register function for buyers and a subscription function for brands.  <br><br>
The buyer will have an option that takes them on a virtual walk through of the aisles in the ‘trade 
show’ where brands will showcase the products they’re selling for that season. The buyer can choose 
to interact with sales staff that are available for live voice chat and the buyer can view products 
by entering the brands stand. The buyer can then look at products more closely by clicking on a 
product which will result in their local 3D hologram being displayed on their desk in front of 
them. Ideally the product will display in 1:1 size ratio and will be in a slow spinning display 
with full colour. <br><br>
Motivation<br><br>
Reed Gift Fairs have an exhibitor profile of 2,694 brands over 82 different gift, home & 
lifestyle categories. Their database is reaches out to 42,000+ buyers globally. Their physical
 trade shows are extremely costly to the brands that exhibit and to the buyers that must
 travel to them. <br><br>
My platform will assist buyers to do their job without the cost and time that goes into
 attending a physical trade show. Aside from the cost and time factors, recent global health
 issues also play a major part in move towards a virtual event over a physical one. Costs will 
still be involved however, I imagine they will be a fraction of the cost of a physical show
 and convenience is also a major part of the appeal. <br><br>
Description <br><br>
My platform and hardware extension will have specific elements that are an integral part of 
why this software is successful. <br><br>
Being ultimately user-friendly this platform will be very easy to use so that buyers with all 
levels of technical experience can enjoy and work effectively without wasting time trying to figure 
it out. After the initial login the buyer is simply clicking arrows to point in a direction to navigate
 their way to what would look like the aisles of a physical trade show, like how google maps 
works when using the street view function.  Once the buyer comes across a brand or product 
they are considering, they click on the brand icon and can choose to interact with the 
representative or simply browse the product in the trade show ‘shop’. The brand representative 
would be able to communicate via VOIP or text chat box to ask/receive questions or take request 
for a ‘showing’ appointment. <br><br>
At physical trade shows, buyers can behave incognito so to avoid unwelcome attention from 
brands. This often results in missed opportunities on the brands behalf which, as a business who 
are paying for a service to benefit the buyer, is not ideal. Therefore, a function is built into the 
program so that when a pre-flagged buyer comes within close virtual proximity to your ‘shop’, you 
get a warning. The live function from the representative’s end always shows all the customers 
within their shop and also provides updates from time spent away. <br><br>
A live look at the brands shop back end, would show all buyers within their current space by way 
of a map. Think of Harry Potter’s Marauder's Map but being able to virtually tap on a 
customer’s shoulder and introduce yourself and start a conversation. <br><br>
In order to attend the trade show, buyers must register with their business and trading name, 
business type and ABN. All buyers are verified before being approved and a minimum purchase 
agreement must be adhered to unless an exemption has been prior approved. This is to remove 
trade show tourists, to protect the IP of the brands and keep the event a true trade only event. 
Putting these functions and requirements into place will make sure that the representatives are 
only spending time with genuine buyers and not ‘time-wasters’. <br><br>
When buyers are in the shop, items that are clicked on will pop up on the buyers external hardware
 device in hologram form with ratio index. From there, the customer can choose to add it to 
their shopping cart. This hologram function is particularly unique and gives more well rounded 
view of the item they are considering.  <br><br>
To streamline the process for buyers, leaving the check out process until they have finished 
all purchasing from each brand will be a big time-saver and will also help to keep track of their 
spending. <br><br>
Tools & Technologies <br><br>
Adobe Flash or Javascript is required for the shop aisle viewing portion of the platform. CAD will also
 be required to design the shop fronts. A 3D photographer and their equipment needs to be used by
 the brands and a hologram projector needs to be sourced by the buyer or provided to the buyer. 
For adding to cart and shopping function, Shopify would work with some adjustments. Teams can 
be used for the rep to buyer communication. A tracking software would also be required for the
 function where the rep can view which buyers are within their store. <br><br>
Skills Required <br><br>
A web developer is required for this project. A visual merchandiser and web designer also. Hardware 
required is a personal hologram device and software to bring at all together. <br><br>
Drawbacks or Obstacles <br><br>
A drawback is that this virtual trade show concept already exists but without the hologram function.
 I have not experienced the tools, functions and display offered by these businesses because you 
need industry access to view the platform. Therefore, I am unaware of the direct competition at 
this point and need further research for the product to determine it specifically unique and viable. <br><br>
The personal hologram device is a product that needs work over the next 5 years to improve
 the technology and make it more commercially available. <br><br>
Outcome <br><br>
If this project is successful, many trade events across multiple industries that would normally require
 physical attendance would become obsolete. Therefore, allowing businesses to spend their time 
and money within other areas of the business rather than needing to use it for exorbitant traveling 
costs. An added bonus is the reduction in greenhouse gasses produced by the transport network
 because buyers will no longer need to use the network and the issue of increased risk to health due to 
the spread of virus is eliminated. <br><br>
